description-longue : <br><b>This Workshop will be in english.</b></b><br><b>A Gentle Introduction to Bayesian Methods with Python</b> <p>Bayesian techniques present a compelling alternative to the frequentist view of statistics, providing a flexible approach to extracting a swathe of meaningful information from your data. The learning curve is somewhat steep, but the benefits of adding Bayesian techniques to your tool suite are enormous! <p>What are the bare essentials that you need to know to start applying Bayesian techniques? This talk will provide an entry level discussion covering the following topics<p>What can Bayes do for me? (A brief introduction to Bayesian methods)<p>Understanding Markov Chain Monte Carlo. (MCMC is what happens behind the scenes)<p>What is Stan? (Writing models in Stan)<p>Using Stan in Python. (The PyStan package)<p>The talk will be peppered with useful tips for dealing with the initial challenges of using Stan with Python.</p>
